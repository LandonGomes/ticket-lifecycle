Intake form

  This is where users (clients) of the osTicket service will fill the form out with referenced information. You'll need an email address that's been added into the system, full name, usually a phone number but in this instance we do not have one and then select a help topic from the drop down list.

Filling intake form out

  As a user you may not have the exact cause or reason for the issue person (business, individual, costumer) is experiencing so just fill out best you can. Help Topic drop down has several preloaded  categories to select from: Business Critical Outage, General Inquiry, and Personal computer issue. The goal here is to add as much pertinent information for the help desk Agent.

Reworking a Ticket

  Once a ticket has been submitted by a user, Agents should review the ticket and verify and make additional changes if required. On this ticket we can see priority level was orginally set to "Normal" based on the breif discription described by the User we can assume this could have a impact on business. You would click Priorty and this pop-up will show, once here you'll see the Priority level and you can change it, in this case to emergency. You'll notice you have to option to provide an optional reason but it's not required.

<p>
Resolving Ticket

  Looking over the picture you can see that changes have been implemented. Note SLA has been set to SEV-A meaning this the most critical metric and it's imparative that this metric is met. During this phase is where the Agent(s) will work on resolving this issue and provide updates via Ticket Thread.

<p>
Resolved (Closed) Ticket

  In this picture you can see that the ticket has been resolved and we can determine that based on the fact that the ticket is closed. On the previous screen where we saw the Ticket Thread there is an option at the bottom of the screen to close the ticket once resolved.
